## Definintions

IDE: An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source-code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Examples of an IDE are VSCode, RStudio, PyCharm, and NetBeans.

## Using an Internal Shell
Most IDEs have an internal terminal which allows the user to interact with their computer environment without leaving the IDE. This allows the user to run external commands and perform build tasks which helps with long chain workflows. This level of integration requires the IDE to be present in the systems' PATH envrionment.
