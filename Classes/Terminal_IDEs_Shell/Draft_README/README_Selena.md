Terminal: a text-based interface that allows the user to write commands directly to the computer's operating system. Most computers will have a default terminal, but different programs may have their own terminals that can converse with the computer's operating system as well. Note that different operating systems may use different languages.

## Find Your Terminal

The Terminal will vary for different operating systems: 

### For Mac
In your computer's search, type "Terminal". Click the app to open.

### For Windows
From the Start menu, type "Command Prompt". Click the app to open.

## Using Your Terminal
Now that the app is open, it will usually appear as a small, mostly-blank window with a line of text in the top left. You will always work in the line farthest to the bottom. The line at the bottom will provide some information about where you're working, including where in the directory you're working. Some Terminals are particular about how you write in it. For example, you may not be able to "go back" with your cursor to correct a typo; instead, you may have to backspace back to the point in the mistake.

## Some terminal/command line basics:
- * pwd = print working directory; sending this command will ask the computer to return an answer to the question "where am I working right now?"
- * ls = list; sending this command will ask the computer the question "what are the other items in the folder where I'm working?"
- * cd [folder] = change directory; goes into a folder in the directory you're in. inside the [brackets] you'll put the name of the folder you want to work in.
- * cd .. = change directory, go up one level

- * and many more! feel free to google other commands specific for your operating system
