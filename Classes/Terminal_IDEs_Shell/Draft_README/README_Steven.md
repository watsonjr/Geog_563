## Definintions

IDE: An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source-code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Examples of an IDE are VSCode, RStudio, PyCharm, and NetBeans.

## Using an Internal Shell
Most IDEs have an internal terminal which allows the user to interact with their computer environment without leaving the IDE. This allows the user to run external commands and perform build tasks which helps with long chain workflows. This level of integration requires the IDE to be present in the systems' PATH envrionment. 

## Shell 
a program that provides a command-line interface, letting users interact with the operating system by typing commands such as navigating folders, running programs, or managing files.
## Shell Scripting
the practice of writing those commands in a text file (a script) so they can be executed automatically in sequence, allowing users to automate tasks, manage workflows, and save time on repetitive operations.

## Benefits of Terminal Use
Allows for faster access to all available commands
Enables users to work directly with any part of the system (files, processes, memory locations, etc.)
No mouse is neccessary when using terminal
