Terminal: a text-based interface that allows the user to write commands directly to the computer's operating system. Most computers will have a default terminal, but different programs may have their own terminals that can converse with the computer's operating system as well.

Some terminal/command line basics:
- * pwd = print working directory; answers the question "where am I working right now?"
- * ls = list; answers the question "what are the other items in the folder where I'm working?"
- * cd [folder] = change directory; goes into a folder in the directory you're in. inside the [brackets] you'll put the name of the folder you want to work in.
- * cd .. = change directory, go up one level
