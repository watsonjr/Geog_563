# Weekly Workflow Github Repo Practice

Each week, you and your team will work on one of the topic folders in our class GitHub repo (e.g., `Terminal-IDEs-Shell/`, `Scientific-R/`). Your job is to create or update the `README.md` file in that folder, then share your work with the class through GitHub.  

Don’t worry if you’ve never used GitHub before—just follow these steps each week.

## 1. Setup (first time only)

1. **Install GitHub Desktop**  
   Download and install: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

2. **Log in**  
   Open GitHub Desktop and log in with the GitHub account I’ve invited to the class repo.  

3. **Clone the class repo**  
   - In GitHub Desktop → **File → Clone Repository**  
   - Choose the class repo (should appear under your account).  
   - Save it in a convenient folder on your computer (e.g., `Documents/ClassRepo`).

## 2. Weekly Authoring Assignment (Team Work)

When it’s your team’s week to *write* a README.md:  

1. **Create a new branch**  
   - In GitHub Desktop, click the branch menu (top bar) → **New Branch**.  
   - Name it:  
     - `topic-terminal-teamA` (if you’re working on Terminal, IDEs & Shell scripting)  
     - `topic-r-teamB` (if you’re working on Scientific coding in R)  

2. **Edit the README.md**  
   - On your computer, open the repo folder.  
   - Go to your topic folder (`Terminal-IDEs-Shell/` or `Scientific-R/`).  
   - Open `README.md` in any text editor (VS Code, Atom, Notepad, etc.).  
   - Add your team’s content (overview, steps, examples, pitfalls, further reading).  

3. **Commit your changes**  
   - Return to GitHub Desktop. You’ll see the files you changed.  
   - Write a short **Summary** (e.g., “Draft Terminal README with intro and examples”).  
   - Click **Commit to [your branch]**.  

4. **Push to GitHub**  
   - Click the **Push origin** button to upload your branch to GitHub.com.  

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - In Desktop, click **Create Pull Request** OR go to GitHub.com → you’ll see a button to “Compare & pull request.”  
   - Title: `Terminal README – Team A (Week 2)` or `Scientific R README – Team B (Week 2)`  
   - Description: List what you added + any questions for reviewers.  
   - Assign reviewers (your peer team).  
   - Click **Create pull request**.

## 3. Weekly Peer Review Assignment

When it’s your team’s week to *review* another team’s work:  

1. **Go to GitHub.com → Pull Requests**  
   - Find the PR created by the other team.  

2. **Read the README.md carefully**  
   - Use the **Peer Review Rubric** to guide your review (clarity, accuracy, completeness, examples, resources).  

3. **Give feedback**  
   - Open **Issues** for big suggestions (e.g., “Add an example of running a script from the terminal”).  
   - Add **inline comments** directly on lines of the README in the PR.  
   - Be specific, constructive, and respectful.  

4. **Submit your review**  
   - On the PR page, click **Review changes** → choose **Comment** or **Request changes**.  
   - Do *not* click Approve until you feel the README meets the rubric.  

---

## 4. Revision & Final Merge

- The **author team** will revise their README based on the peer review.  
- They commit and push changes to the same branch.  
- Once reviewers approve, the PR can be merged into `main` (by Squash & merge).  
- The branch is then deleted to keep things tidy.

## 5. Class Workflow at a Glance: Week 1

**Week A – Writing**  
- Team A: Write `Terminal-IDEs-Shell/README.md`  
- Team B: Write `Scientific-R/README.md`  

**Week B – Reviewing**  
- Team A: Review `Scientific-R/README.md`  
- Team B: Review `Terminal-IDEs-Shell/README.md`  

**Week C – Revision**  
- Teams revise their work → merge into `main`.  

Instructor reviews final repos and assigns grades.

## Tips & Common Mistakes

- Always create a **new branch** for your work. Don’t edit `main` directly.  
- Always **push your branch** before making a Pull Request.  
- If you don’t see your changes on GitHub.com, you probably forgot to push.  
- If you get stuck, ask for help in Issues—you’ll learn more by working through it together.
