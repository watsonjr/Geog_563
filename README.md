# Analytical Workflows for Earth Systems Science

Welcome to the course webpage for GEOG 463/563 at Oregon State University! This repository will contain all resources for the course.

## Course Description
This course explores data science methods used to gather, validate, organize, analyze, and summarize large amounts of environmental and ecological information. Focuses on developing analytical workflows that are efficient, reproducible, and modular using scientific coding languages, and version control and collaborative coding environments. Examines case studies including climate change, biodiversity assessments, epidemic modeling, marine spatial planning, and natural resource management.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1) Design and conduct a research project involving the analysis of  environmental data
2) Apply best practices in data collection, cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and visualization
3) Read and write scientific code 
4) Implement best practices in scientific programming to promote reproducible research
5) Manage collaborative research projects using a version control system

In addition, graduate students will be able to:

6) Select and cite relevant research articles
7) Synthesize their findings into a broader environmental context

## How each week works
This will be a flipped course. This means that each week:

1) Students will review study resources and come to class prepared to work on weekly problems. 
2) There will be an assignment where students will perform exploratory data analysis on a new dataset.
3) Students will spend most of their time in class working on their term projects. 

The term project is the main focus on the course. Students will work on their term project in small groups, and there will be assigments periodically through the term on their projects. In addition, each week students will be expected to report on progress using updates to their project's Github repo (this will be described in the first week).

## The Course at a Glance
- Week 1: introduction to the course, people, and term project. 
- Week 2: coding fundamentals (R, Python, Julia, Matlab, Mathematica), the 1-page pitch
- Week 3: github, terminal, learning how to learn (stackoverflow, llms)
- Week 4: data (wrangling, QCQA), plotting using code, exploratory data analysis, 
- Week 5: lab reporting (the 10 minute presentation)
- Week 6: mid-term presentations
- Week 7: high performance computing (HPC)
- Week 8: machine learning I
- Week 9: machine learning II
- Week 10: term project reporting and presentations
