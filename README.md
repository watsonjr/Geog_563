# Analytical Workflows for Earth Systems Science

Welcome to the course webpage for GEOG 463/563 at Oregon State University! This repository will contain all resources for the course.

## Course Description
This course explores data science methods used to gather, validate, organize, analyze, and summarize large amounts of environmental and ecological information. Focuses on developing analytical workflows that are efficient, reproducible, and modular using scientific coding languages, and version control and collaborative coding environments. Examines case studies including climate change, biodiversity assessments, epidemic modeling, marine spatial planning, and natural resource management.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1) Design and conduct a research project involving the analysis of  environmental data
2) Apply best practices in data collection, cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and visualization
3) Read and write scientific code 
4) Implement best practices in scientific programming to promote reproducible research
5) Manage collaborative research projects using a version control system

In addition, graduate students will be able to:

6) Select and cite relevant research articles
7) Synthesize their findings into a broader environmental context

## Course Modules and Organization, and Term Project
This will be a flipped course: each week students will review study resources and come to class prepared to work on weekly problems. Throughout the term, students will work on a term project. There will be assigments specifically for the term project, as well as weekly assignements.
